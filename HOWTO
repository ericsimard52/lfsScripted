How to compile LFS with this?
After cloning the repo into your home directory, proceed with seting up the partitioning.
When building manually, you set partitions and users later, but those are parts of pkm startup check.
User lfs does not need to be there, pkm will create it.
Partition needs to be ready to use, filesystem created on it.
They do not need to be mounted, pkm will take care of this.
The mount point will be created if needed.

After pkm.conf is set, you can start pkm.sh as your normal user.
Your password will be requested by sudo when needed.
When pkm is ready, proceed with loading versionCheck pkg: loadpkg <RET> vers <RET>
pkm will do a search for vers* and ask you to confirm what it found.
